# 🧙‍♂️ Follow me on this long quest to turn chaos into clarity

I'm a **freelance web & app developer** with a deep passion for clean architecture, logical thinking, and solving real problems. 
I help companies **improve their digital products** by building well-structured, maintainable, and scalable solutions — not just code that works, but code that *makes sense*.

### 💼 What I do

I work with teams and startups to:
- 🚀 Develop web & mobile applications using modern technologies
- 🔍 Identify weak spots and improve existing projects
- 🧠 Bring structure and clarity to codebases, using a **divide et impera** approach
- 💬 Contribute ideas and constructive feedback, not just blindly follow specs

I'm not just another dev who "gets the job done" — I'm the one who *cares* about doing it right.

### 🔧 Tech stack I work with

- **Frontend**: `HTML5`, `CSS3`, `JavaScript/TypeScript`, `React`, `Next.js`, [`Miniframe`](https://github.com/9elt/miniframe)
- **Backend**: `Node.js`, `Express`, `Prisma`, `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Google Firebase`
- **App**: `React Native`, `Expo SDK`
- **Software**: `C`, `Java`
- **UI/UX**: `Figma`, `Adobe Illustrator` [(check on Dribbble)](https://dribbble.com/ontech7dev/about)
- **Currently exploring**: OpenAI’s APIs & tools — building smarter UIs with AI

I also enjoy contributing to open-source. I’ve helped fix bugs in tools I use daily — from frontend libraries to Expo SDK internals.

### 🎯 Outside of code

When I’m not coding, I’m probably:
- 📸 [Photographing](https://500px.com/p/ontech7/galleries/photos) life moments
- ☕ Dialing in the *perfect* [espresso](https://vimeo.com/1109594645) or cappuccino with freshly ground beans
- 🧗 Climbing plastic walls (indoor bouldering)
- 🛠️ 3D printing stuff on my BambuLab P1S
- ⌨️ Building custom mechanical keyboards
- 🎮 Ranking on PC games
- 🎧 Getting lost in high BPM electronic music — mostly *drum & bass*

---

### 🧠 Open to new opportunities

I'm always curious about **collaborating on exciting projects**, especially with early-stage startups that value strong engineering foundations.

Feel free to reach out — I’m open to freelance gigs, part-time collaborations, or contributing to something meaningful.
